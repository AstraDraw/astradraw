# Documentation Standards

Documentation must stay in sync with the codebase. Follow these rules to keep docs relevant and fresh.

## When to Update Documentation

### 1. New Feature Implementation

When implementing a new feature:

1. **Create documentation** in `/docs/` folder with:
   - Feature overview
   - How it works
   - API endpoints (if any)
   - Frontend components (if any)
   - Configuration/environment variables

2. **Add to feature table** in `README.md`

3. **Update `ARCHITECTURE.md`** if the feature affects system architecture

### 2. Modifying Existing Features

When changing existing functionality:

1. **Update the relevant doc** in `/docs/`
2. **Add a changelog entry** at the bottom:

```markdown
## Changelog

| Date | Changes |
|------|---------|
| 2025-12-20 | Fixed duplicate API prefix bug |
| 2025-12-15 | Added avatar upload functionality |
```

### 3. Bug Fixes

When fixing bugs that affect documented behavior:
- Update the doc to reflect the fix
- Remove any "Known Issues" entries that were resolved

## When NOT to Update Documentation

**Do NOT update docs until:**

1. ✅ Code changes are committed
2. ✅ `just check` passes
3. ✅ Docker deployment tested
4. ✅ User confirms feature works

**Ask the user**: "The feature is implemented. Should I update the documentation now, or do you want to test it first?"

## Known Issues Format

```markdown
## Known Issues

### Issue: Description

> ⚠️ **Problem**: What's wrong
> 
> **Impact**: How it affects users
> 
> **Status**: 🔴 Needs fix / 🟡 Low priority / ✅ Resolved
```

### Issue Status Labels

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 🔴 Needs fix | Critical, blocks functionality |
| 🟡 Low priority | Works but not ideal |
| ✅ Resolved | Fixed, kept for history |

## Cursor Rules Updates

**Only update `.cursor/rules/` when:**

1. A pattern is confirmed to work after testing
2. A common issue is discovered and solved
3. A new workflow is established and verified

**Do NOT add to rules:**
- Speculative patterns
- Untested workarounds
- One-time fixes
