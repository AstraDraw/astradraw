# Multi-Repo Workflow for AI

This project has code in multiple folders that work together.

## Project Structure

```
astradraw/           # You are here (main workspace)
├── frontend/        # React/Excalidraw app (UI, components)
├── backend/         # NestJS API (auth, database, storage)
├── room-service/    # WebSocket server (collaboration)
└── docs/            # Feature documentation
```

## When User Requests a Feature

### Step 1: Understand Scope

| If feature involves... | Check these locations |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| UI/components | `frontend/excalidraw-app/components/` |
| API endpoints | `backend/src/` |
| Database changes | `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` |
| Real-time collab | `room-service/src/` |
| Existing patterns | `docs/` folder first |

### Step 2: Read Documentation First

**Always check `/docs` before implementing.** Look for:
- Similar features already documented
- Established patterns to follow
- Known issues and solutions

### Step 3: Propose Before Implementing

For multi-repo features, propose a plan:

```
I'll need to make changes in:

**Backend:**
- Add endpoint X
- Update schema Y

**Frontend:**
- Create component Z
- Add to sidebar

Should I proceed with this plan?
```

### Step 4: Implement in Order

1. **Database schema** (if needed)
2. **Backend API** - controllers, services
3. **Frontend API client** - `auth/workspaceApi.ts`
4. **Frontend UI** - components, styles
5. **Translations** - both `en.json` and `ru-RU.json`

## Cross-Repo API Pattern

```typescript
// Backend: backend/src/feature/feature.controller.ts
@Get('api/v2/feature')
@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)
async getFeature() { ... }

// Frontend: frontend/excalidraw-app/auth/workspaceApi.ts
export async function getFeature() {
  const response = await fetch(`${getApiBaseUrl()}/feature`, {
    credentials: "include",
  });
  return response.json();
}
```

## What NOT to Do

- ❌ Don't implement frontend that calls non-existent API
- ❌ Don't skip reading docs for "simple" features
- ❌ Don't make changes without understanding existing patterns
- ❌ Don't forget translations in both locale files
